# ICT and the Environment
Our information society can play an important role in reducing the environmental impact of industry and society, and helping us understand our environment so that we can better protect it.
It has both positive and negative impacts.
#### Positive impacts:
- **Mobility reduction**
- **Massive packaging reduction**
- **Monitoring Earth changes**
- **Smart Water management**:
	(collegabile a [[Smart cities]] che si basano, tra le varie cose, anche su questo)
#### Negative impacts:
- **High consumption of electric energy**
- **E-waste**
- **Tourism pollution**
- **Global warming**
- **Paper waste**
In order to safeguard the environment, the key words are *public awareness* and *education*: green policies and economic strategies, collaboration and cooperation are essential in order to think green and to act green.
