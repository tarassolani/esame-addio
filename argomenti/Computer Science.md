# Computer Science (p. 14)
Computer Science (CS) isn't just the study of programming, but also a good card to play when looking for a real job opportunity in the new global economy.
In the 1960s, when the first CS Division at Stanford University was founded, it was considered as the *right answer to the continuous developments and advances in computing courses*.
The first definition, coined by the founder of the CS Division (George Forsythe) was "*the theory of programming, numerical analysis, data processing and the design of computer systems*".
Since the 1960s, CS has evolved, becoming such a vast subject that it has become difficult to find a precise definition.
Nowadays, CS allows students to broaden their skills in problem solving, reasoning and analysis, and CS professionals are expected to manage different steps of team-work activities and to communicate with experts from different fields.
One of the most recent and complete definitions of CS is given by LINFO (Linux Information Project): "*Computer science is the study of the [[Informatica|storage, transformation and transfer of information]]. This field encompasses both the theoretical study of algorithms (design, efficiency and application) and the practical problems of implementing them in terms of computer hardware and software*".
CS is, therefore, a field in continuous evolution.
